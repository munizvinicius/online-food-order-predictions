This is project in that I made predictions whether a person will make a online food order or not - using Machine Learning model. 
All credits to the website thecleverprogrammer.com for share the article wrote by Aman Kharwal which helps me to learn how I can do it.
It was developed in Jupyter Notebook environment.
The following libs were used (remind to install all of them before run the code):

Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn.
